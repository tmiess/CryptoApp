### Intro
Anyone is free to explore CryptoBase. The only feature that requires user authentication is CryptoChat, which we will get to later.

As you can see, the home page of CryptoBase is very straighforward. You are prompted to either See, Learn, or Talk via the three tabs on the menu bar. You can dive right in by using our real-time conversion tool on the top right, or you can interact with live price charts on the right side of the page.

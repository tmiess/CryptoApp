### Intro
Anyone has the freedom to explore CryptoBase. The only feature that requires user authentication is CryptoChat, which we will get to later.

The home page of CryptoBase is very straighforward. You are prompted to either See, Learn, or Talk via the three tabs on the menu bar.

You can dive right in by using our real-time conversion tool on the top right.
